          <p>Saint John Neumann was a Redemptorist Catholic priest and the fourth Bishop of the Diocese of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
            He emigrated to the United States from his native Bohemia, now the Czech Republic, and became a citizen and is
            the first male American saint in the Catholic Church.</p>
          <p>Known informally as 'the Little Bishop' due to his small stature, Saint John Neumann is widely recognized as the
            founder of the American parochial school system. Under his administration, the number of diocesean schools jumped
            from one to 200, and enrollment lept from 500 to 9,000 students in just two years.</p>
          <p>Bishop Neumann died suddenly on January 5, 1860, and was interred beneath the basement floor of Saint Peter the
            Apostle Church, a Redemptorist parish in Philadelphia where Bishop Neumann often visited, preached and spent
            time with his confr√®res.</p>
          <p>Saint John Neumann's body now lies in a glass-enclosed reliquary beneath the altar of the National Shrine of Saint
            John Newmann in the lower level of Saint Peter the Apostle Church.</p>
